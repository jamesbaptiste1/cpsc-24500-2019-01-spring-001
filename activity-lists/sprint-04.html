        <p><b><i>Welcome to sprint 4.</i></b> We have covered a lot of material in the first three sprints. I suspect that the 
            FaceDraw programming assignment was challenging. As we near the halfway point of our course, we will continue to focus 
            on delivering real software each sprint. This week we will continue with enhancing our programming skills by 
            learning how to develop <b><i>interactive</i></b> applications while also learning how to read and write files.</p>
        <p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                <li>Develop <b><i>interactive</i></b> graphical Java applications utilizing Listeners</li>
                <li>Describe how to develop <b><i>interactive</i></b> command-line Java applications utilizing Scanner</li>
                <li>Develop Java applications that read and write files including JSON files</li>
                <li>Understand JavaDoc and how it can create self-documenting source code</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Please let me know if you need assistance. If you struggled with FaceDraw, it might help if we had a chance to sit 
            down and talk through how we can get things back on track for the remainder of the course. I am here to help.</p>
        <p>Our activities list for this sprint is provided below:</p> 
        <ol>
            <li>Review and start to work on Programming Assignment 4 and Quiz 4. Be careful not to accidentally submit the 
                assignments until you have completed all of the questions. If you need to resubmit an assignment, you will 
                have to re-enter your answers to all the questions.</li>
            <li>Lab: Complete ActionListenerPlus tutorial 
                    <a href="https://mediaatoz.azurewebsites.net/display-video.html?video-url=https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/cpsc-24500-2018-sp-001/java-action-listeners.mp4" 
                    target="_blank">[video]</a></li>
            <li><b><i>Complete and be prepared to discuss items 1 and 2 in class on the first Thursday of the Sprint</i></b></li>
            <li>Lab: Complete the <b><i>MosaicLite</i></b> tutorial
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/java-mosaic-lite.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a>. Note that the source code utilized in this tutorial is available in the 
                "MosaicLite" folder in our Course Materials repository. ~1.5 hours</li>
            <li><b><i>Complete and be prepared to discuss item 4 in class on the second Tuesday of the Sprint</i></b></li>
            <li>Compete Mosaic. I anticipate that our Mosaic assignment will be of similar difficulty to FaceDraw. Maybe a 
                little bit easier because you are a better Java developer than you were last sprint. I expect the project will 
                take you approximately 10 hours to complete. If it takes you significantly longer (or shorter), I would be 
                interested in your feedback on how we could improve the assignment. ~10 hours</li>
            <li>Review the answers from last week's programming assignment and quiz. </li>
            <li><b><i>Complete your initial Discussion Board (DB) post in the first half of the Sprint</i></b></li> 
            <li>Lab: OvalDraw Plus Menus and Colors <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/java-ovaldraw-plus.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a> ~1.5 hours.</li>
            <li>Review the Java file documentation provide by Oracle 
                <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/package-summary.html" target="_blank">[link]</a></li>
            <li>Review the related Java file tutorials provided my Oracle 
                    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/" target="_blank">[link]</a>
                    and complete and complete one of the tutorials.</li>
            <li>Lab: Complete the BMI with JavaDoc and Scanner (keyboard input) tutorial 
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/bmi-calculator-add-javadoc-and-keyboard-input.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a>.
            <li><b><i>Complete all remaining items including  submitting Programming Assignment 4, Quiz 4, and responding to one of your classmate's 
                Discussion Board posts by the end of the Sprint</i></b> ~1 hour</li>
            <li>Give yourself a special reward at the end of the sprint. You have made it to the halfway point!</li>
        </ol> 
        <p>Feel free to post something in our "Class Forum" discussion board forum or to send me an email you have any 
            questions. Also, be watching for Announcements through Blackboard during the week as I am sure that something will 
            come up.</p>  
        <p>Good luck and please let me know if you are having difficulties.</p>
