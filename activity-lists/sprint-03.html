        <p><b><i>Welcome to Sprint 3.</i></b> We have covered a lot in the first two sprints. Much of it was preparing us for 
            our first substantial programming assignment. I believe we are ready to apply what we have learned to our FaceDraw 
            project. Be sure to get an early start on the project and stay focused. You will note that there are fewer items on 
            our activities list this week. That is because you will need to focus your time and energy on FaceDraw.</p>
        <p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Develop a moderately sophisticated graphical Java application (FaceDraw)</li>
            <li>Comfortably utilize our Java development environment</li>
            <li>Utilize source code management and Git/GitHub</li>
            <li>Effectively compile, debug, submit, update, and manager our Java application source code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As you would expect, our activities list for this sprint (below) is laser focused on helping us achieve the above 
            Learning Objectives. Once again I have attempted to list this items in the order that I think will be most 
            beneficial for you to complete them.</p> 
        <ol>
            <li>Review and start working on Programming Assignment 3 and Quiz 3. Once again, I suggest going through them in 
                their entirety at the start of the sprint as it will allow you to plan your efforts more effectively</li>
            <li>Complete "Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) in Java" lesson 
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/java-gui-programming.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a> ~1 hour</li>
            <li>Review last week's quiz. Many of the same topics will come up in the future so it is more important that 
                you understand the concepts than that you got a given question correct.</li>
            <li>Take one last look at "How to Be a Success Programmer" suggestions and intentionally decide if there is 
                something you are going to change now that the programming assignments are becoming more challenging. 
                <a href="successful-programmer.html" target="_blank">[link]</a></li>
            <li><b><i>Complete and be prepared to discuss items 1 through 4 in class on Thursday, February 14th</i></b></li>            
            <li>Lab: Complete the FaceDrawLite tutorial
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/java-facedraw-lite.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a>. The source code utilized in this tutorial is available in the "FaceDrawLite" folder
                in our source-lite folder. ~1.5 hours</li>
            <li>FaceDraw, FaceDraw, FaceDraw ~8 to 12 hours</li>
            <li><b><i>Complete your initial Discussion Board (DB) post by the evening of Sunday, February 17th</i></b></li> 
            <li><b><i>Complete your initial FaceDraw implementation and be prepared to discuss it in class on Tuesday, 
                February 19th</i></b></li>                
            <li><b><i>Complete all remaining items and submit Programming Assignment 3, Quiz 3, and your DB3 response to a 
                classmate by Sunday, February 24th at 11:59pm.</i></b> ~1 hour assuming you have 
                completed the above activities</li>
            <li>Take time and reward yourself for your efforts and accomplishments. FaceDraw is a challenging assignment.</li>
        </ol> 
        <p>Feel free to post something in our "Class Forum" discussion board forum or to send me an email you have any 
            questions. Also, be watching for Announcements through Blackboard during the week as I am sure that something will 
            come up.</p>  
        <p>Good luck and please let me know if you are having difficulties.</p>
