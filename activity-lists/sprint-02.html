        <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
        <p><b><i>Welcome to sprint 2.</i></b> We covered a lot of material in sprint 1. However, we didn't get a chance to write much 
            code. This sprint get your Java compilers out. We are going to start practicing some of the concepts we learned. </p>
        <p>As usual, we will be holding our lecture/lab sessions TTh from 2-3:15pm in room AS 104A. Your attendance and 
            participation in the lecture/lab sessions is expected and appreciated.</p>
        <p>Below is the list of activities that we will need to complete this sprint. Although you are welcome to 
            pursue the activities in any order you prefer, I am listing them in the order I think will be the most beneficial 
            for you to work through the topics. The time commitment for each line item is generally 20 to 40 minutes unless 
            otherwise noted.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Review and start working on Programming Assignment 2 and Quiz 2. Once again, I suggest going through the 
                assignments in their entirety at the start of the sprint as it will allow you to plan your efforts more 
                effectively</li>
            <li>Lab: If you do not already have a favorite source code editor, please install Visual Studio Code. Note that I would 
                <b><i>not</i></b> recommend using a generic text editor like "Notepad" for this class. Installing Chrome as your 
                browser is recommended but optional

                target="_blank">[video]</a>
                <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">[download]</a></li>
            <li>Sign up for Safari Books Online (which is available to you free through Lewis University) and 
                perform a search for "Java" on the Safari Books website
                <a href="https://lewisu.libguides.com/az.php?a=s" 
                target="_blank">[link]</a></li> 
            <li>Lab: Install and/or verify that you have correctly installed the Java development environment 
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/environment-configuration/java-jdk-windows10-setup.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a></li>
            <li>Review the answers from last week's Quiz 1. Many of the same topics will come up in future so it is important 
                that you understand the concepts question.</li>               
            <li>Lab: Complete the Java "Hello World" tutorial. As in <b><i>all</i></b> labs, you should follow along and complete 
                the steps yourself. As you go through the lab, you should make the resulting application uniquely you own by 
                adding standard comments at the top application (i.e. your name), changing the names of variables, adding small 
                features, etc. Finally, be sure to keep your unique lab creation as I will often be asking you to submit it as 
                part of your assignment.

            <li><b><i>Complete and be prepared to discuss items 1 through 6 in class on Thursday, January 31st</i></b></li>
            <li>Lab: Complete the Java "Shapes Step 1" tutorial. Once again as will all labs, be sure to follow along and 
                complete the steps yourself, to make the resulting application uniquely your own, and to be ready to submit 
                your version of the application as part of an Assignment.

                and then utilize your GitHub account to create, update local and remote repositories by completing

            <li>Once again, be sure to take some time and reward yourself for your efforts. Get a coffee and spend some time 
                reflecting on what you've accomplished. It is important to take a little time to enjoy the moment. </li>
