    <p>Wow! Sprint 5. How did that come so fast? I must say that I am impressed. This is a challenging class and it's obvious 
            that you are working hard and delivering assignments that you are proud of delivering. Well done! </p>
        <p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Develop your first network/distributed Java application</li>
            <li>Create a web service (website with JSON) utilizing the MS Azure cloud platform</li>
            <li>Develop intermediate command line Java applications</li>
            <li>Describe multiple Object-Oriented Languages and Platforms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This sprint you will likely notice two changes. First, we will be taking a bit of a break from Java graphics 
            programming and instead will focus our energy on Internet &amp; distributed programming and JSON. I think you will 
            enjoy the change. But don't worry, we will get back to Java graphics programming soon enough. </P>
        <p>The second change you will see starting this sprint I will be looking for you to do more of your own research and 
            decision making on assignments. For example, you will see topics this week relating to setting up Microsoft Azure 
            static websites, accessing JSON files from Java, and developing more complex Java command line applications. In 
            each of these cases I will be giving you some direction but will be looking for you to do the research and make 
            your own choices on how you would like to implement solutions. </p>
        <p>Our activities list for this sprint include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Review and start to work on Programming Assignment 5 and Quiz 5. </li>
            <li>Lab: Setup a Microsoft Azure account with a Microsoft Imagine educational subscription 
                    <a href="https://imagine.microsoft.com/en-us" target="_blank">[link]</a>
                Or optionally, set up your account with a free trial subscription
                    <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/" target="_blank">[link]</a>. 
                Although your free trial will last 30 days, you will need to provide a credit card. You will also want to watch 
                what types of resources you access on your Azure account so that when you convert the account to "pay-as-you-go", 
                you will not experience any significant charges. For this class I will be guiding you toward free or very low-cost 
                cloud resources.</li>
            <li>Review "What is JSON? JavaScript Object Notation explained"
                    <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3222851/javascript/what-is-json-javascript-object-notation-explained.html" 
                    target="_blank">[link]</a>
                    and “JSON Introduction” from W3C
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp" target="_blank">[link]</a> 
            <li>Complete "DB5: Personal Information JSON Files" which includes defining and creating a JSON file for yourself 
                and posting it in our DB5 forum</li>
            <li>Lab: Create a free static Microsoft Azure Website and deploy an index.html Landing Page to the site using one 
                of the methods demonstrated below. Test your website and make certain that your index.html Landing Page is working 
                as expected. ~2 hours
                <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                    <li>Review "Git Deployment to Microsoft Azure" (highly recommended) 
                            <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/environment-configuration/git-deployment-to-azure.mp4" target="_blank">[video]</a>
                    <li>Review "Eric's Azure Static Website" with FTP tutorial 
                        <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/web-and-distributed-programming/my-first-website-with-ftp.mp4" target="_blank">[video]</a></li>
                    <li>Review "Create a static HTML web application in Azure" tutorial 
                        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-html" target="_blank">[video]</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Lab: Repeat the step above and create another static website that you will leave in place for the duration of this 
                class. We will be utilizing this site to deploy JSON files for us to access</li>
            <li><b><i>Complete your initial Discussion Board (DB) post by Thursday</i></b></li> 
            <li>Review the answers and comments from your Sprint 4 assignments</li>
            <li>Compete the SwissArmyKnife assignment. I anticipate that this assignment will be substantially easier than 
                FaceDraw or Mosaic. ~6-8 hours</li>
            <li>Lab: Review the "OvalDraw Plus With Clicking and Dragging" application located in the ShapeDrawPlus folder in
                our course materials. You should compile, run, and test the functionality of the application. Then you will need
                to complete a detailed source code review. Finally, you will create a UML diagram of the primary classes
                and relationships utilized in creating the application. ~2-3 hours</li>
            <li>Review Object-Oriented Programming Languages and Platforms 
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/languages-and-platforms.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a> ~1 hour</li>
            <li><b><i>Complete all remaining items including submitting Programming Assignment 5, Quiz 5, and responding to one 
                of your classmate's Discussion Board posts by Sunday, February 17th at 11:59pm</i></b></li>
            <li>Don't forget to reward yourself!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Feel free to post something in our "Class Forum" discussion board forum or to send me an email you have any 
            questions. Also, be watching for Announcements through Blackboard during the week as I am sure that something will 
            come up.</p> 
       <p>Good luck and please let me know if you are having difficulties.</p>
        <p>Eric</p><br>
