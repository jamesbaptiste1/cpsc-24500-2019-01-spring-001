        <p><b><i>Welcome to Object-Oriented Programming!</b></i> By this point in your academic journey, I'm sure that you've 
            developed some confidence in writing programs. You've learned about procedural programming techniques like 
            sequence, selection, and repetition. You've learned how to break complicated programs down into more manageable 
            pieces. That is great. But, to create modern programs you need to master some additional skills and understand 
            additional concepts. These skills and concepts are what object-oriented programming give us.</p>
        <p>You have likely noticed that I am using the term "sprint" to describe our first two weeks of class. The sprint term 
            is part of the Agile development process. We will be utilizing several Agile process practices during the course. 
            For now, it's enough to know that "sprints" are part of Scrum which is the most popular Agile development process, 
            that each of our sprints will last two weeks, and that our first sprint ends on Sunday, January 27th at 
            midnight.</p>
        <p>As usual, we will be holding our lecture/lab sessions TTh from 2-3:15pm in room AS 104A. Your attendance and 
            participation in the lecture/lab sessions is expected and appreciated.</p>
        <p>Below is the list of activities that we will need to complete in the next two weeks. Although you are welcome to 
            pursue the activities in any order you prefer, I am listing them in the order I think will be the most beneficial 
            for you to work through the topics. The time commitment for each line item is generally 20 to 40 minutes unless 
            otherwise noted.</p>
